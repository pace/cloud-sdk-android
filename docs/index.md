## Migration
### From 2.x.x to 3.x.x
In `3.0.0` we've introduced a universal setup method: `PACECloudSDK.setup(context: Context, configuration: Configuration)` and removed the setup for `AppKit` and `POIKit`.

The universal `Configuration` almost has the same signature as the previous *AppKit* `Configuration`, only the `isDarkTheme` parameter has been removed, which is now an enum instead of a Boolean and defaults to `Theme.LIGHT`. In case you want to change it, you can set it via `AppKit`'s `theme` property: `AppKit.theme = Theme.LIGHT/Theme.DARK`.

### From 7.x.x to 8.x.x
We've added two new `AppCallback`s: `getAccessToken` and `logout`. The `getAccessToken` method replaces the `invalidToken` call. While its callback is equal to the `invalidToken` callback, we changed the response to be an object with an `accessToken` property and a new `isInitialToken` boolean.

The `logout` callback is used to handle the logout natively. Please refer to [Native login, token renewal and logout](#native-login-token-renewal-and-logout) for more information.

Also from now on this callback will only be sent if `IDKit` is not used/set up. If you're using `IDKit` the SDK will now first try to renew the session automatically. If the renewal fails there is a new `fun onSessionRenewalFailed(throwable: Throwable?, onResult: (String?) -> Unit)` AppCallback that you may implement to specify your own behavior to retrieve a new access token. To implement this method pass an `AppCallbackImpl` instance to `AppKit.openApps(...)` or `AppKit.openAppActivity(...)` and override `onSessionRenewalFailed`. If either this method is not implemented or you didn't pass an `AppCallbackImpl` instance at all the SDK will automatically perform an authorization hence showing a sign in mask for the user.

### From 9.x.x to 10.x.x
We've moved everything that belongs to the GeoAPI from `AppKit`/`API` to `POIKit`:
* The `AppKit.isPoiInRange(...)` call is now part of `POIKit`, available under `POIKit.isPoiInRange(...)`
* The two `AppKit.requestCofuGasStations(...)` calls are now part of `POIKit`, available under `POIKit.requestCofuGasStations(...)`
* In case of unresolved references: All classes inside package `cloud.pace.sdk.api.geo` and `cloud.pace.sdk.appkit.geo` were moved to package `cloud.pace.sdk.poikit.geo`

### From 10.x.x to 11.x.x
The `IDKit` setup has been combined with the general `PACECloudSDK` setup:
* `IDKit.setup(...)` is no longer accessible.
* An optional `OIDConfiguration` has been added to the `Configuration` class of the `PACECloudSDK`.
* If you do not pass an `OIDConfiguration`, the `IDKit` can not be used.
* If used, the `OIDConfiguration` needs to be initialized with at least the `clientId` and the `redirectUri` of your identity provider. You can also use the factory methods of the `OIDConfiguration` if you want to use another environment than production which is now set by default with the primary constructor.
* Please head over to [IDKit setup](#setup-1) to learn more about how to set up this functionality.

### From 11.x.x to 12.x.x
The `PACECloudSDK.setup()` has been simplified:
* An optional `CustomOIDConfiguration` has been added to the `Configuration` class of the `PACECloudSDK`.
* If you do not pass an `CustomOIDConfiguration`, the `IDKit` can not be used.
* If used, the `CustomOIDConfiguration` needs to be initialized with at least the `clientId` and the `redirectUri` of your identity provider. All other properties in `CustomOIDConfiguration` can be additionally set if e.g. own identity provider endpoints are wanted.
* Please head over to [IDKit setup](#setup-1) to learn more about how to set up this functionality.

### From 12.x.x to 13.x.x
The `connectedFuelingStatus` property of the `CofuGasStation` is now nullable so that the Cofu gas station is not skipped in the cache loading if this property is absent in the API response.
If you use the `CofuGasStation` object, keep in mind that the `connectedFuelingStatus` property can now be `null`.

### From 13.x.x to 14.x.x
The `GasStations` properties `paymentMethods`, `amenities`, `foods`, `loyaltyPrograms`, `postalServices`, `services`, `shopGoods` and `fuelType` will now be from type string instead of enums. The client app has to then manage these values itself.

### From 14.x.x to 15.x.x

- The `POIKit.getRegionalPrice(...)` function now returns `List<RegionalPrices>` instead of the `RegionalPrices` typealias, which was `List<RegionalPrice>` before. This means that the only difference now is that the `RegionalPrice` model is called `RegionalPrices` and the `RegionalPrices` typealias no longer exists. The properties of the new `RegionalPrices` model are the same as those of the old `RegionalPrice` model.
- The [POI GeoJSON API](https://api.pace.cloud/schema/2021-2/_poi-geojson.html) has been removed because it is an internal API. If you still need this API, please write us on GitHub: https://github.com/pace/cloud-sdk-android.
- The user info request has been revised:
  - You don't have to pass an access token to the `IDKit.userInfo` method anymore, because it is automatically added to the request by the IDKit.
  - You can now add optional additional headers and optional additional parameters to the user info request, just like with the other API requests.
  - The properties of the `UserInfoResponse` model have changed to `subject`, `zoneInfo`, `emailVerified`, `createdAt`, `locale` and `email`. The old properties are outdated.

### From 15.x.x to 16.x.x

- We've removed the `Environment.STAGE` environment completely. Please use `Environment.SANDBOX` during testing and `Environment.PRODUCTION` for everything else.

### From 16.x.x to 17.x.x

- Introduced a `NoSupportedBrowser` exception which will now be returned from all `IDKit.authorize(...)` and `IDKit.endSession(...)` calls instead of crashing the app with an `ActivityNotFoundException` if no supported browser is installed and enabled to handle the Custom Tab intent. In this case, we show a Toast prompting the user to enable Google Chrome.
- The suspendable calls `IDKit.authorize(...)` and `IDKit.endSession(...)` now return the `Completion` result instead of invoking a function parameter on result to make the calls synchronous.

### From 17.x.x to 18.x.x

- Upgraded dependencies for Android gradle plugin, Kotlin and Compose. Make sure client dependencies are compatible or update them.

### From 18.x.x to 19.x.x

- We have refactored our `POIKit.observe(...)` functions to retrieve gas stations:
  - We have removed the caching of the gas stations in the database. Therefore, when the PACE Cloud SDK is initialized for the first time, the `poikit_database` is deleted. Also, Room has been removed as dependency.
  - The new functions to retrieve gas stations now return only live responses, instead of an observable object, which was triggered when there were changes in the database.
  - The new functions are now suspendable functions that return the gas station result instead of triggering a lambda function. Therefore, you must execute them in a coroutine.
  - The following mapping shows which old `POIKit` functions must be replaced with which new `POIKit` function:
    | Old | New |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | POIKit.observe(visibleRegion: VisibleRegion, padding: Double, completion: (Completion<List<PointOfInterest>>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStations(visibleRegion: VisibleRegion, padding: Double, zoomLevel: Int)  |
    | POIKit.observe(ids: List<String>, completion: (Completion<List<PointOfInterest>>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStations(ids: List<String>, zoomLevel: Int) |
    | POIKit.observe(locations: Map<String, LocationPoint>, completion: (Completion<List<PointOfInterest>>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStations(idsWithLocations: Map<String, LocationPoint>, zoomLevel: Int) |
    | POIKit.observe(id: String, completion: (Completion<GasStation>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStation(id: String, zoomLevel: Int) |
    | POIKit.requestGasStations(locations: Map<String, LocationPoint>, zoomLevel: Int, completion: (Completion<List<GasStation>>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStations(idsWithLocations: Map<String, LocationPoint>, zoomLevel: Int): Result<List<GasStation>> |
    | POIKit.getGasStation(id: String, compileOpeningHours: Boolean, forMovedGasStation: Boolean, completion: (Completion<GasStationMovedResponse>) -> Unit) | POIKit.getGasStation(id: String, zoomLevel: Int) |
  - The following functions no longer exist because there is no longer a `POIKit` database:
    - `POIKit.getGasStationLocal(vararg ids: String, completion: (Completion<List<GasStation>>) -> Unit)`
    - `POIKit.getFromBoundingBoxLocal(minLatitude: Double, maxLatitude: Double, minLongitude: Double, maxLongitude: Double, completion: (Completion<List<GasStation>>) -> Unit)`
    - `POIKit.insertGasStations(vararg gasStations: GasStation)`
- The `CdnAPI` class for retrieving `PaymentMethodVendor`s has been renamed to `PaymentMethodVendorsAPI` and moved to `cloud.pace.sdk.api.vendor`. Change the following imports if you use this API:
  | Old | New |
  | ------ | ------ |
  | import cloud.pace.sdk.poikit.poi.download.CdnAPI | import cloud.pace.sdk.api.vendor.PaymentMethodVendorsAPI |
  | import cloud.pace.sdk.poikit.poi.download.CdnAPI.getPaymentMethodVendors |  import cloud.pace.sdk.api.vendor.PaymentMethodVendorsAPI.getPaymentMethodVendors |
  | import cloud.pace.sdk.poikit.poi.download.PaymentMethodVendor |  import cloud.pace.sdk.api.vendor.PaymentMethodVendor |

### From 19.x.x to 20.x.x

- We have re-implemented our local available apps and AppDrawer logic to make it even easier for you to integrate our Plug & Play solution into your app:
  - The view-based AppDrawer has been rewritten in Jetpack Compose. This makes it possible to include our solution in Jetpack Compose apps as well as in view-based apps.
  - Our solution now consists of two components:
    - AppDrawerHost: This component requests local available apps and shows them as AppDrawers. When the location changes (please make sure that the location permissions are granted), new apps are requested and the AppDrawerHost updates the AppDrawers. **Therefore you don't have to call `AppKit.requestLocalApps(...)` for every location update anymore, if you want to use our Plug & Play solution.** The `AppKit.requestLocalApps(...)` function still exists, if you want to implement a custom AppDrawer behavior.
    - AppDrawer: This component declares the UI of the AppDrawer.
  - **Jetpack Compose apps:** You can simply call the `AppDrawerHost` composable function in your app composable function. We recommend placing the `AppDrawerHost` so that it is displayed above the rest of your app's content and aligned from the bottom.
  - **View-based apps:** We also introduced an `AppDrawerHostView`, which is a regular view and internally calls the `AppDrawerHost` composable function as content. You can then add this view in your XML layout or programmatically if you do not use Jetpack Compose.
- Added a new `onShow(apps: List<App>)` AppCallback that is triggered when a list of AppDrawers is displayed. The `apps` parameter contains the currently displayed AppDrawers.
- The functions `AppKit.openApps(...)` and `AppKit.closeApps(...)` have been deleted, as this is now done automatically by the AppDrawerHost.
- Added a `LocationRequest` parameter to the `POIKit.startLocationListener` function so that you can specify the desired location criteria for the location request.
- Added a `locationFlow(...)` function to the `LocationProvider` so that you can fetch location updates using a Kotlin Flow.

### From 20.x.x to 21.x.x
- We have refactored our `Configuration` object that is used in the `PACECloudSDK.setup(...)` function: We have added `clientID` as property to `Configuration` and removed it from `CustomOIDConfiguration`.
- We have raised the min sdk version to 26 (Android 8).
